# XC16++ for XC16 v1.26

Important notice! The device headers (i.e. `xc.h`) shipped with upstream XC16
are no longer compatible with options `-std=c++98`  and `-std=c++0x`. If your
project uses one of those, replace it respectively with `-std=gnu++98` or
`-std=gnu++0x`.

This XC16 version is supported by XC16++ since v2.

## Installation

Install XC16 first, then follow instructions in the [README file](../README.md)
in the parent directory.
